In this I have made 2 packages in Python.
One package is able to show live Application task performing when any activity or application is running (memory.py).
The another is YouTube package which shows the logs of YouTube and gets us the live logs and response of the application (youtube.py)
You need to run the files on the CMD after downloading the folder.
Type CMD in Address Location Bar
Then write [python memory.py / python youtube.py] to run the file
Remember your phone should be adb connected. For this the Root of the phone is Recommended.
